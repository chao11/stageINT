 The “fdt_path” file is your tractography result, the “fdt_matrix?.dot” ( ? can be 1,2,or 3 ) file is the connectivity matrix. You can import this file to matlab by using the following command line

X = load(‘fdt_matrix2.dot’);
CM = spconvert(X);

The connectivity matrix will be saved in the variable “CM” as a sparse matrix. Or you can use this line to make it into a full matrix.

CM = full(spconvert(X))

Now, the most important piece of information: the voxel coordination is saved in “ coor_for_fdt_matrix?.nii.gz” file. ( Again, ? can be 1,2,or 3 ). To use this file, use the following command line (make sure that you already added freesurfer/matlab to your path):

Coor = load_nifti(‘coor_for_fdt_matrix2.nii.gz’)
Coor is a 5 by N matrix. The first three columns are the X, Y, Z coordinates of the voxels in your seed or mask (depending on which matrix options you choose). The fifth row is their voxel index in the connectivity matrix. 
(in our case we get seed voxel index)




1. run 'read_probtrack_Matrix.py' convert the fdt-matrix.dot to connectivity matrix with the dimension of M*163, M voxels in seed mask and 163 targets
the result is saved by joblib as a list. list[0]is the conectivity matrix and list[1] is the lable numbers
